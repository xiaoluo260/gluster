beanstalkc
==========

beanstalkc is a simple beanstalkd client library for Python. [beanstalkd][] is
a fast, distributed, in-memory workqueue service.

beanstalkc depends on [PyYAML][], but there are ways to avoid this dependency.
See Appendix A of the tutorial for details.

beanstalkc is pure Python, and is compatible with [eventlet][] and [gevent][].

[gevent]: http://www.gevent.org/
[PyYAML]: http://pyyaml.org/


Usage
-----

Here is a short example, to illustrate the flavor of beanstalkc:

    >>> import beanstalkc
    >>> beanstalk = beanstalkc.Connection(host='localhost', port=14711)
    >>> beanstalk.put('hey!')
    1
    >>> job = beanstalk.reserve()
    >>> job.body
    'hey!'
    >>> job.delete()

For more information, see [the tutorial](TUTORIAL.mkd), which will explain most
everything.
